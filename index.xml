      <description>Armenian Common Voice was launched in May 2021. I have accumulated popular questions from a diverse community of developers, linguists, educators, hobbyists, etc. for better context on what it is and how you can help.
What is Armenian Common Voice? 
What help is needed? 
Is there a timeline? 
What does the voice corpus look like? 
How are dialects addressed? Is there a voice corpus for each dialect similar to how the language is split in Wikipedia?</description>
