And following the ceremony and teary-eyed student goodbyes, would follow the luncheon, in which our final goodbyes to the faculty would take place, whether it be a temporary ‘see you later’ or permanent departure.

That moment, of seeing all the kids take their last minute pictures with each other, making their final farewells to the staff, reuniting with their families with hugs and kisses, that moment was truly beautiful.  I felt so present, so happy to be there, seeing the kids together one last time and bidding our farewells..    </p>\\n<p>It was at that point that I should’ve left.

This was the school’s way to properly acknowledge my achievements and bid me farewell.  Hearing the other farewell toasts after mine, which were all beautifully delivered with prepared scripts, made me feel even worse about it.
