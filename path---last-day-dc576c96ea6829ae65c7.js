It was one of those moments in my life that felt heavy and familiar — it resembled the emotions that I experienced when I graduated college or the time I moved to San Francisco by myself. There were feelings of sadness, no doubt, but I’m not sure I will ever find a perfect combination of words to describe yesterday’s emotions.  </p>\n<p>Before the last day of school, I pictured what it would look like: an auditorium filled with a ton of techie parents, wearing their usual jeans-tshirt-blazer-for-special-occasions ensemble, happily watching/documenting their child’s middle school graduation, and then listening to disappointingly plain speeches about life achievements from adults who don’t educate. And following the ceremony and teary-eyed student goodbyes, would follow the luncheon, in which our final goodbyes to the faculty would take place, whether it be a temporary ‘see you later’ or permanent departure. Of the farewell toasts that would be given, I pictured mine to be mediocre, as I didn’t really develop social relationships with my colleagues.   Picturing the dreadful closure with the school really didn’t sound appealing, and I actually tried to think of ways to avoid going.  I was worried that the very nature of the last day’s program was going to lead to an improper, unprofessional mark of closure with me and the school.</p>\n<p>Despite my pessimism, I sucked it up and went.  The ceremony’s speeches were plain as expected.  Very disappointing, as that room was filled with over a billion dollars worth of Silicon Valley talent. The kids looked lovely, though.  They were so excited, so scared, and so sad all at the same time, as they approached me for our final goodbyes.  That moment, of seeing all the kids take their last minute pictures with each other, making their final farewells to the staff, reuniting with their families with hugs and kisses, that moment was truly beautiful.  I felt so present, so happy to be there, seeing the kids together one last time and bidding our farewells..    </p>\n<p>It was at that point that I should’ve left. But recalling a conversation with my boss, one of the few obligations requested was to attend the luncheon.  So, I felt the need to follow my word.  The luncheon was just the thing that I worried would happen - spoil my closure with my the school.  The farewell toast that was given to me was terse, unprepared, and partially didn’t make sense.  And that was it.  This was the school’s way to properly acknowledge my achievements and bid me farewell.  Hearing the other farewell toasts after mine, which were all beautifully delivered with prepared scripts, made me feel even worse about it. It indeed reminded me that I had no friends at work. It reminded me of the lack of support I get on a normal basis and the immense amount of work that goes unrecognized, unacknowledged. I felt alone.  I felt empty. I felt my contributions were void. It didn’t matter. I was disposable.</p>\n<p>Closure at work, especially when 100% of times are stormy, dysfunctional, leaderless, and multi-faceted, is super important. A meaningful closure is part of the backbone of professionalism. It serves as a final channel of communication between the departing employee and the company, in which the employee and employer can exchange their final feedback, words, and sentiments. I feel beyond grateful that I received recognition from the children and their parents, as that’s what truly matters.  The various forms the children expressed their gratitude towards me as a math teacher made the farewell process so meaningful, that I fantasize that this was the way my career as a teacher ended.  </p>\n<p>Time to move onward.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"My last day at school",date:"June 23, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/last_day/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/cleaning-up-data/"},frontmatter:{title:"Part 1  Cleaning Up Data"}},next:null}}}});
