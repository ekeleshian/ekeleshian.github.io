</a> The wheel that keeps Common Voice spinning is getting people to donate their time and voices to grow public datasets - in Common Voice&rsquo;s case, a collection of multi-lingual <a

</a> below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More validations.</strong> For quality assurance, each audio recording must be validated by other peers from our subcommunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Better data representation.</strong> Wikipedia text is not enough to build production-ready speech-to-text (STT) systems. 1- it does not contain any conversational/dialogic text.  2- the miniscule Western Armenian content misrepresents the vast amount of Western Armenian text out there in the real world. 3- we should be mindful always about gender imbalance to avoid bias around voice tone and pitch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5 hours of validated recordings</strong> needed at minimum to build production-ready speech-to-text models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-are-dialects-addressed-is-there-a-voice-corpus-for-each-dialect-similar-to-wikipedia">How are dialects addressed? Is there a voice corpus for each dialect similar to wikipedia? <a href="#how-are-dialects-addressed-is-there-a-voice-corpus-for-each-dialect-similar-to-wikipedia" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Wikipedia hosts two sites for armenian content, hy.wikipedia.org and hyw.wikipedia.org, due to differences in orthography.  The main question we faced before the launch was should we follow the same pattern with Common Voice, i.e. split the language to two voice corpora based on dialect? We<sup>1</sup> discussed this through a collection of facebook posts, virtual meetups and google doc collaboration with experienced developers and linguists, including one coder who worked as a software engineer in Google Translate&rsquo;s team.</p>
<p>We decided that the <strong>language split in general is a bad idea</strong> and hence maintain <strong>one voice corpus</strong> with both hy.wikipedia and hyw.wikipedia sentences. Why? -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are many polycentric languages already launched in Common Voice, including English, Arabic, Portuguese, French, and Spanish. They each maintain one voice corpus.  The Armenian language is not any more special than the languages that are already deployed and generating revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The split has already hurt Western Armenian. Take a look at the volume of hy.wikipedia and hyw.wikipedia content.  The difference is embarassingly wide - hyw has less than 10% the content of hy. The result is a devastating domino effect of abandonment due to hyw&rsquo;s silo&rsquo;d status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It confuses developers and scientists outside the Armenian community when they see multiple Armenian language data sources. The confusion typically leads to either abondoning the less popular one (likely Western Armenian) or abandoning the language altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even Mozilla says that various accents/dialects are a good thing. The more variance in speaker data, the more robust the model will be in catching corner cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case with STT models, our system should take input from all forms of Armenian speech and be able to process them. In general, the burden should be on the developer to write better code that handles various incoming audio. The burden <em>should not</em> be on the user to manipulate their speech just so the model can work.</p>
</li>
</ul>

If you do one minor stutter - forgivable. More than one, please re-do the recording.  Validators should also reject recordings that contain more than one speech flaw.</p>
