Due to my academic\nbackground in this topic, I have been very eager to explore financial\nliteracy amongst Americans. Luckily, I found some awesome\ndata with a pretty extensive Google Scholar search. A questionnairre was\ndistributed in 2015, asking Americans about their monetary management skills,\nspending behavior, investments (if any), plans for\nretirement, and a six-question quiz assessing the surveyee’s\nfinancial knowledge.  The database contained more than 27,000 survey submissions, each\ngenerating more than 100 data points of responses.</p>\n<p>This database had some messy qualities.  I recall opening\nthe csv file into Excel and feeling totally dumbfounded; the data\nlooked meaningless — just rows of arbitrary alphanumeric\nsequences that deemed it impossible to do any analysis.\nFortunately, in the directory of this database also included a pdf file of a key of all\nalpha numeric codes and their translations.  It contained the\nquestion and multiple choices of every survey question from the data.\nWith this access, I realized that luck played a huge role with\ngetting this project started (and that Google is amazing!). So, this prompted\nme to clean up the data, reformatting the data so that it was actually\nreadable.   </p>\n<p>I wrote a python file that contained dictionaries of the survey’s\nalphanumeric codes and their respective translations.</p>\n<p>![Decoding Questions](./Screen Shot 2018-06-10 at 4.14.43 PM.png)</p>\n<p>I wrote a chain of functions that call </p>",frontmatter:{title:"Exploring Data on Financial Literacy",date:"June 10, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/rule-of-thumb/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/recent-project/"},frontmatter:{title:"From Math Teacher to Data Science n00b"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/new-beginnings/"},frontmatter:{title:"From Math Teacher to Data Science n00b"}}}}}});
