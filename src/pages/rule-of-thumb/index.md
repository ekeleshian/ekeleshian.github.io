title: Rule of Thumb

I am fortunate to be part of an environment that truly facilitates my growth
in a new field. SF has spoiled me with various resources, including 
new friends, meet ups, hackathons, conferences, workshops, code&coffee events, 
etc, etc. In a way, it would be almost foolish not to flourish.

As someone new in the field, I sometimes let it all overwhelm me... all the
uncertainties and questions in my head can often blur my vision.  My partner, who
I also consider a mentor, shared some piece of wisdom that I keep returning
to as I study data science. Here they are:
1. KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)
2. Stick to one language (in my case, Python)
3. Networking is your moment to shine.
4. Question everything.
