Mondays usually feel pretty *bleh*.  Even the internet dictates so-- just Google 'Monday Memes' and you will literally find zero positive messages. But the Monday after Outside Lands was entirely different.  It substantially changed my life. After a strenuous phone interview, I got accepted to Data Science Retreat, a three month program with intensive machine learning application.

I jumped on the opportunity, especially after doing extensive research on the company.  But did I feel ready?? 

LOL.... no.

I had all these ~feels~ entering in my head and not constructive ones either.  Insecure thoughts started rushing through my head, especially after learning that this program typically admits people with PhD's or have work experience in tech.  As I don't have either of those things, I started to question the whole thing altogether. _Am I going to be able to do this?  Will I be helpful at all to the team?  Are my colleagues going to perceive me as a heavy cost more than anything else?_  

### Building Emotional Strength

Fortunately, I immediately sensed that my attitude was going to be a problem and that I needed to fix it right away before going to Berlin.  With the daily self-reflections and the help of my friends and family, I feel nothing more than **HYPED** about this adventure.

I want to share a list of things I worked on in order to get these toxic thoughts out of my head: 

1.  **Recognize the nature and implications of my attitude.**
	+  This was due to daily self-reflection.  Had I not reflected on my emotional stress, the poison would have buried deep in my subconscious, which in the long term would make it exponentially harder to fix.
2.  **My only competition is the person I was yesterday.**
	+  I have to remind myself this everyday, so that I don't get caught up in noise. 
3.  **Continue learning.**
	+  Yes, the program will cover data science material, but this shouldn't deter me to continue my progress with MOOC's.  This way, retention is going to be a lot easier; furthermore, I will be able to think deeper about the concepts, which will allow me to ask deeper questions and thereby optimizing my interactions with my cohort and instructors/mentors.
4.  **Prepare 20-30 ideas for the capstone project.**
	+ The heart of the program is the capstone project, as we start on it week 1 till the end.  This is going to be my trademark, my brand, something I will proudly show off to future employers, so I have to make sure I have at least 20 interesting ideas. 
5.  **Talk to data scientists by attending meet-ups.**
	+  I learn more about how the range of data science practices, as data science entails so much more than machine learning.  I pick their brains, retain the buzz words, am cognizant of their diction **especially** with technical things.
6.  **Find people who did the program on LinkedIn and shoot them a message.**
	+  I ask them concrete questions about the program, and I make sure to be mindful of their time. 
7.  **Create if-then rules to program my mind to be as productive as possible.**
	+  Examples: If I go on Facebook, then close it and go on HackerNews. If I feel homesick, then listen to music.  If I am stuck on something for a long time, then take a walk.  (This really works for me as I respond well to rules.)
8.  **Continue working on minor projects and pushing them on github.**
	+  Similar to item #3, but the distinction here is that the projects should be my own.  This way, I get to explore and hone in on which data science applications interest me.
9.  **Find housing ASAP.**
	+  I did not procrastinate on this, especially after learning that there are high demands for housing AND acknowledging the fact that I'm at a big disadvantage for not being in the country.
	+  I actively searched in many housing platforms, including wg-geschult, immobielien24, airbnb, coachsurfing, Berlin housing facebook groups.
10.  **Utilize the networking capabitilies of social media platforms to their fullest damn potential.**
	+ I (very reluctantly, but now gratefully) activated facebook to join Berlin groups, including those that focus on housing.  I found my studio via Facebook, despite the fact that most German locals recommend their specific housing websites.
	+ I go on Reddit more frequently to learn about Berlin.
	+ I find tech meet-ups and try to RSVP in advance. 
	+ I join female-centered facebook groups-- it's a great avenue to be transparent, social, and knowledgable about the culture and the scenes.
11.  **Read about tech team dynamics, the good, the bad, and the ugly.**  
	+ I think about how the stories could resonate with me in terms of my own weaknesses and strengths.
	+ I will keep these in mind as I work with my cohort.  I will actively improve on myself via self-reflection and being optimistic (I'll fake it if I have to) so that I can be the best team member I can possibly be.
12.  **Find an outlet that will _immediately_ up my mood.**
	+ Right now, Nicki Minaj's new album is working like magic in terms of motivating me.


Every item in this list has been a benefactor in terms of making me feel more secure about this transition.  The moral of this story, which for me is the main recipe for success, is this: 

>_Mind over matter._
